# Story Book Readme file

## Description

A fullstack MERN application meant to act as a capstone project for my journey though the Perscholas SE bookcamp.
The application primarily uses Canvas to draw and create the images. Dnd-Kit to order and interact with the pages to create a story, and finally BootStrap to display the images.
Blob files were used to save the images directly to the database instead of using a file server.


## Usage/Purpose

The goal of **Story Book** is to provide a seamless platform where creativity and simplicity intersect. By offering robust tools and an intuitive interface, Story Book allows users to focus on crafting their stories without getting bogged down by technical complexities. Whether you're creating bedtime tales, educational content, or personal narratives, Story Book caters to storytellers of all levels, enabling them to bring their visions to life with ease.
